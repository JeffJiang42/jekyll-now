## What are your expectations for this course?

I think my expectations for this class are mostly shared by my classmates. I
expect the course to be a good (though somewhat limited; there's only so much
you can do in a semester) overview of what development would be like in the
real world. Since I have little experience with web development, I think
that this course will be a valuable experience, since it will help me
pick up many of the tools I've neglected to learn, and become more well
rounded as a CS student. I think that it will also teach me the skills
necessary to work well with a group (managing time, communication, organization,
etc.).
