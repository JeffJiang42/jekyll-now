title: Week 1: Back to Work

## What are your expectations for this course?

I think my expectations for this class are mostly shared by my classmates. I
expect the course to be a good (though somewhat limited-- there's only so much
you can do in a semester) overview of what development would be like in the
real world. Since I have little experience with web development, I think
that this course will be a valuable experience, since it will help me
pick up many of the tools I've neglected to learn, and become more well
rounded as a CS student. I think that it will also teach me the skills
necessary to work well with a group (managing time, communication, organization,
etc.).

## What did you do the last week?

A lot of this week was spent preparing myself mentally for the semester.
I'm taking a pretty heavy course load this semester, with two CS courses
(This one and Computer Vision) as well as two difficult math classes--
Algebraic Structures 2 and a conference course in Riemannian Geometry with
Professor Neitzke. This semester really started quickly on the math front.
I met with Professor Neitzke on Wednesday, and after looking through the
book we planned to work with, gave us 11 exercises regarding Lie groups
and Lie algebras. I will also be presenting a small talk with for the
two other people working with me on Monday, so I've been doing a lot of work
right out of the gate. The other math class is with Professor Keel, who wasted
no time on the first day by having us prove that every finitely generated
abelian group is a direct sum of cyclic groups. I think
his teaching style is pretty similar to Downing. He doesn't really lecture,
but instead asks students to go to the front and walks them through
proving certain theorems. It's pretty intimidating and you have to think on
your feet, which mirrors Downing calling out students in class.

On the CS front, things have started a bit slower. We've mostly gone overview
administrative details and high level concepts in both Software Engineering
and Vision, and the first assignment for Vision is mostly just learning
our way around Matlab.
