title: Closing Thoughts - Final Entry

## What did I like least about the class?

I wish that more of the lectures would help us on the web project.
I thought that the presentations given by the proctors were pretty helpful,
so more of them would have helped our project get off the ground at the
beginning. Some of the daily quizzes were a bit frustrating as well, but I don't
feel too strongly about that. In addition, the focus on agile development for
the projects (e.g. stories, testing) seemed a bit weird to me. While for the
most part I agree in some sense with the agile mindset, I don't think
it's the right way to organize the projects when we are learning everything
on the fly. For example, I would argue that it's impossible to implement
test-driven development if you're learning as you go. How are we supposed
to write tests first if we don't understand what we're suppose to make
yet?

## What did I like most about the class?

I enjoyed the process of learning how to build our own website, and as one
of the main frontend developers, I've learned a lot of React this semester,
which is definitely a valuable skill to have. As a silver lining, one
of the consequences of the lectures being disjoint from the project material
is that I've become a lot more comfortable learning things on my own. In
addition, the process of building something with a team I was very fun and
rewarding. Finally, the weekly blogs were pretty fun. I thought it was
nice to sit down on Fridays/Saturdays and reflect on my week, though
I imagine some of my peers did not particularly enjoy/understand my
digressions into math.

## What's the most significant thing you learned?

I think the most significant thing I've learned is React. Prior to this
class, I had no web development experience whatsoever, so the fact that I've
come out the other end with a decent (though still incomplete) understanding
of React is a pretty big accomplishment in my mind. My learning
in this class was mostly outside of lecture, so I'm also a lot better
at learning independently, which I also find to be extremely valuable.

## How many hours a week did you spend coding?

I don't have a good estimate, but I'd say roughly 20-30 hours over 2 weeks.
Our group had a pretty bad habit of not starting the projects until around
the week it was due, so the amount of time I spent coding for the class
fluctuated a lot (looking at the GitHub insights was pretty interesting for our
team). If we were better with our time, I would say probably 10 hours a week
wouldn't be an unreasonable estimate.

## How many hours a week did you spend reading?

I spent roughly 1-2 hours reading a week for the course, but I fell off
around the last 2-3 weeks due to a bunch of projects and assignments piling up.
Overall, I think the readings were ok, but some of the concepts seemed a bit
outdated at tines.

## How many lines of code do you think you wrote?

A quick glance at our frontend code repository puts my estimate at around
2000 lines of code.

## What required tool did you not know that you found useful?

Honestly, most of the tools packaged with React (e.g. npm, mocha, React itsef)
were all things I was completely unfamiliar with prior to the course, so
I found those things to be the most useful thing I've learned in this course.

## What's the most Web dev tool your group used that was not required?

I think most of the tools I used were actually required, so I can't comment
too much, but the member of my team that wrote the Selenium tests found
a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/katalon-recorder-selenium/ljdobmomdgdljniojadhoplhkpialdid?hl=en-US)
that essentially wrote the code for you. I think the gist is that
you just click around the website, and then those actions are then
processed into code, which made writing Selenium tests much easier for us.

## If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?

I think more presentations early on about the project would have been helpful.
A bit challenge for us was simply figuring out what specific tools did, and
how to actually use them (e.g. how to set up using create-react-app). Spending
a lecture or two near the beginning of the web project would have helped
us get off the ground much easier. As a suggestion maybe one or two days
per phase could be a "workshop," where the TAs and proctors would
walk around and help our groups with whatever issues they're having,
or point groups in the right direction.

## Closing thoughts

Overall, I think the course was a good, but flawed learning experience.
I think Downing is an excellent teacher, and learning the tools independently
has made me a better programmer, but it was definitely daunting learning
how to swim by being thrown into the ocean. I think the style of
Downing's lectures are better suited for a class like functional programming
or object-oriented programming (which he teaches!). I think another valuable
thing I learned in this class is just that web development isn't the best
match for me. This isn't a slight against the class -- I just find that
my interests in computer science do not align very well with web development.
I probably would have discovered this one way or another, but it's better
to figure this out from a class in college rather than 3 months into a
software engineering job.
