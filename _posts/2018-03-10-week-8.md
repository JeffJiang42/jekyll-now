title: Week 8 - Spring "Break"
---

## What did you do the last week?

Much of the last week was spent studying for my vision exam on Thursday.
I made some silly mistakes, (like saying minimize rather than maximize)
but I think overall the exam went alright. After the exam was over, I gave myself
a short break, but my attention quickly returned to algebra. Unfortunately, we've
been given a take home exam that is due next Thursday, so my mind has mostly been
on that recently. Luckily, the exam seems somewhat reasonable, so I (hopefully)
will be able to finish it before the end of this weekend.


## What's in your way?

Sadly, I have a mountain of work to overcome this break. In addition to my midterm,
most of Phase 2 of IDB will have to be finished over spring break. I've looked into
React the last week and have managed to rebuild a few parts of the website using React,
but I'm still getting some logistics figured out as to how to integrate that with Flask.
I've noticed a few people posting suggestions regarding how to accomplish this, but
I haven't been able to get it to work in a way that I like, so I'll have to look into
that over the break.

In addition, I will have to prepare a talk for the Monday following spring break.
We've made good progress in the reading course with Professor Nietzke, so my next
talk will be over the generalized Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, called the
[Laplace-Beltrami Operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplaceâ€“Beltrami_operator)
(or sometimes the Laplace-De Rham Operator), which generalizes the Laplacian
you might be familiar with $$\Delta = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} $$
There's an equivalent notion of a Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, but it generalizes quite
nicely to an operator on objects called [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form)
(which is the machinery behind the scenes when you integrated in your multivariable calculus class)
The construction of the operator is pretty involved, so I'll need to hammer down the
details this break.

Overall, there's a lot on my plate for my so called "break," but I want
to make some time to relax over the next week. I plan to meet with some friends,
and it will be nice to spend some time with my family and our dog.

## What will you do next week?

The plan is to relax as much as possible next week, which sadly might not be
that much. Again, I need to work on my part of the project, and I have a midterm
and talk in the way at the moment.

## What's my experience with the class?

I think this week was pretty interesting. The presentation Quang and Kasra
gave this Monday was pretty useful (can we have the slides?) and I found
the talk on ethics very interest. I noticed that a lot of students link
articles regarding ethics in computer science, (specifically AI) so it
was cool to hear it from former professors that taught a course on the topic.
The part that most resonated with me was when they mentioned that some
physicists on the Manhattan Project probably just thought they were solving the
coolest physics problem.

## Tip of the week

Enjoy your spring break! I know many people (especially in Math and CS)
have demanding schedules, so spring break is a good halfway point to
slow down and reflect on the semester. Use this time to reinvigorate yourself
and finish the semester strong!

That being said, it feels a bit weird saying that knowing that I probably
won't be able to follow my own advice. Hopefully your spring break will be
more relaxing than mine!
