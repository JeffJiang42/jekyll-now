title: Week 9 - Crunch Time
---

## What did you do the last week?

As a recap of spring break, I got a lot of work done and still managed
to find some time to relax and meet with some friends. That being said,
it wasn't nearly as relaxed as I would have liked, but my break was definitely
better than anticipated. The first few days were ultra productive, as I
finished my Algebra midterm quite early and wrote some essays for a scholarship.
In addition, I wrote up notes for my talk for Professor Neitzke, which
you can read [here](../files/laplacian.pdf) if you wish. I'll also be giving
this talk to the UT Math club (with minor modifications to make the material
easier to digest) next Friday, so you can come and say hi, though I must admit
the mathematical prerequisites are quite high. After those were done,
the rest of the break was spent learning React and getting the frontend of
our website set up.

This week was mostly spent working on Phase 2 of our project. Over spring break
I managed to pick up React and set up a majority of the frontend of our website,
but there was still a lot to do this week. Early this week, the backend members
of our team got the API up on our EC2 instance, and then I went back to work
rendering that data on our website. One challenge that I did not anticipate
was the sheer amount of data we had. As of now, we have nearly 3000 courses
in our database (and this is without using data from one of our API sources),
so we had to implement some more advanced pagination already. Overall, I think
this phase of the project went pretty well, and I think we all picked up
a lot of the skills quite quickly. I know some teams have one or two people
that are pretty well versed in web development already, but our team doesn't have
this luxury, so I'm pretty proud of us for doing all of this by the seat of our
pants.

On the math side of things, I gave my talk, and somehow managed to finish
my algebra homework despite having Phase 2 looming overhead. We've started
talking about connections on Riemannian manifolds, which I think are very cool.
The general idea is the idea of differentiating vector fields. If you took
differential equations or vector calculus, you might have differentiated vector
fields in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. However, on general manifolds, it gets much trickier,
since we don't know how to transport information between points, which is the
purpose of a connection.

## What's in your way?

We got our vision assignment this week, and we got the necessary details to do
it by the end of Thursday. I plan on getting most of this assignment done this
weekend. As mentioned before, there's some reading to be done over connections as
well. Finally, I want to meet with my team over the details of the next phase,
since we have less time to complete Phase 3.

## What will you do next week?

Nothing too new for next week. Mostly the same deal of getting the weekly
assignments done. As I said before, I'll also be giving a talk next Friday.

## What's my experience with the class?

I have no complaints as of now. I like that we've started talking about SQL,
which I feel will be very helpful for the upcoming phase, since we're going
to have to implement sorting and filtering. It's probably more of a backend thing
though, so I might not use the knowledge as much as some other team members,
but it's good to know what's going on under the hood when I make API calls on
the front end.

## Pick of the week

Probably a bit out of place in the context of my previous tips and picks,
but I've recently become a big fan of a candy called Randoms (you can find them
at HEB)

I get them from time to time when I want a pick me up. They're also quite fun,
since (as the name suggests), the gummies are shaped like random objects.
My roommates and I have a lot of fun seeing what kind of objects we get.
