I plan to keep various notes and miscellaneous projects I've worked on
linked here. If you find any typos or (god forbid) logical errors in
anything here, feel free to contact me.

* I took the quantum computing course in spring 2017 with Professor
Aaronson, and compiled some notes along the way
  - [Quantum Computing Notes](../files/QuantumComputing.pdf)

* I also took a differential topology course in spring 2017 and compiled
lecture notes for the course. (**WARNING**: These notes are littered with typos
and mistakes)
  - [Differential Topology Notes](../files/M382D.pdf)

* In the summer of 2017, I spent some time working through a book on
Lie Groups, which is a mathematical topic of interest.
    - [Notes on Lie Groups](../files/LieGroups.pdf)

* In spring 2018, I prepared a talk for a conference course with Professor
Neitzke about the generalized Laplacian on a Riemannian Manifold.
